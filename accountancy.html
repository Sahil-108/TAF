        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Introduction to Accountancy</h2>
            <p>Accountancy is the process of recording, summarizing, analyzing, and reporting financial transactions
                of a business or organization.</p>
            <p>It provides essential information for decision-making, resource allocation, and performance evaluation,
                both internally within the organization and externally to stakeholders such as investors, creditors,
                and regulatory authorities.</p>
            <p>Key concepts in accountancy include assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses, balance sheets,
                income statements, cash flow statements, and financial ratios.</p>
            <p>Understanding accountancy is crucial for effective financial management, compliance with accounting
                standards, and ensuring transparency and accountability in business operations.</p>

                <li><strong>Liability Accounts:</strong> Record obligations and debts owed by the business, such as
                    loans, accounts payable, and accrued expenses.</li>
                <li><strong>Equity Accounts:</strong> Record the owner's or shareholders' equity in the business,
                    including capital contributions, retained earnings, and dividends.</li>
                <li><strong>Revenue Accounts:</strong> Record income earned by the business from its primary

                <li><strong>Expense Accounts:</strong> Record costs incurred by the business to generate revenue,
                    including salaries, rent, utilities, and supplies.</li>
                <li><strong>Income Summary Account:</strong> Temporary account used to summarize revenue and expense
                    transactions before transferring the net income or loss to the owner's equity.</li>

        </div>

        <!-- Slide 3: Accounting Principles -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Accounting Principles</h2>
            <p>Accounting principles are fundamental guidelines and rules that govern the practice of accountancy and
                ensure consistency, accuracy, and transparency in financial reporting. Some of the key accounting
                principles include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Revenue Recognition Principle:</strong> Recognize revenue when it is earned and
                    realizable, regardless of when cash is received.</li>
                <li><strong>Matching Principle:</strong> Match expenses incurred to generate revenue in the same
                    accounting period to accurately reflect the costs associated with earning revenue.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Principle:</strong> Record assets at their original cost, reflecting the cash or
                    cash equivalent paid to acquire them.</li>
                <li><strong>Conservatism Principle:</strong> Exercise caution and prudence in recognizing revenue and
                    recording expenses to avoid overstating assets or income.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency Principle:</strong> Use consistent accounting methods and procedures from one
                    period to another to facilitate comparability and analysis of financial information over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Materiality Principle:</strong> Focus on reporting information that is material or
                    significant enough to influence the decisions of users of financial statements.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 4: Financial Statements -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Financial Statements</h2>
            <p>Financial statements are formal records that present the financial performance and position of a
                business or organization. The main types of financial statements include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> Provides a snapshot of the company's financial position at a
                    specific point in time, showing assets, liabilities, and equity.</li>
                <li><strong>Income Statement:</strong> Reports the company's financial performance over a specific
                    period, showing revenues, expenses, and net income or loss.</li>
                <li><strong>Cash Flow Statement:</strong> Tracks the inflow and outflow of cash and cash equivalents
                    during a specific period, categorizing cash flows into operating, investing, and financing
                    activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Statement of Changes in Equity:</strong> Summarizes changes in equity accounts over a
                    specific period, including capital contributions, dividends, and retained earnings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Financial statements are essential for assessing the financial health, liquidity, and profitability
                of a business, as well as for making informed decisions about investment, lending, and strategic
                planning.</p>
