            <h2>Introduction to Geography</h2>
            <p>Geography is the study of the Earth's landscapes, environments, and the relationships between people and
                their surroundings.</p>
            <p>It explores both the physical features of the Earth, such as mountains, rivers, and climates, as well as
                the human aspects, including population distribution, economic activities, and cultural patterns.</p>
            <p>Geography is an interdisciplinary field that incorporates elements of natural science, social science,
                and humanities, providing insights into the complex interactions between humans and the environment.</p>
            <p>Understanding geography is essential for addressing global challenges, such as climate change, natural
                disasters, urbanization, and sustainable development.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understanding the Earth:</strong> Geography provides insights into the Earth's physical
                    features, processes, and natural resources, helping us appreciate the planet's diversity and
                    interconnectedness.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Conservation:</strong> Geography contributes to environmental conservation
                    efforts by studying ecosystems, biodiversity, climate change, and sustainable development
                    strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Human Settlements and Urban Planning:</strong> Geography informs urban planning, transportation
                    networks, and land use policies by analyzing population trends, migration patterns, and urban
                    sprawl.</li>
                <li><strong>Disaster Management:</strong> Geography helps identify and mitigate natural hazards, such as
                    earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and wildfires, through risk assessment, disaster preparedness, and
                    emergency response planning.</li>
                <li><strong>Globalization and Development:</strong> Geography examines the spatial dimensions of
                    globalization, trade flows, cultural exchange, and development disparities, guiding policies for
                    sustainable development and reducing inequalities.</li>
