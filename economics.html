        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Introduction to Economics</h2>
            <p>Economics is the study of how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies allocate resources
                and make decisions to satisfy their wants and needs.</p>
            <p>It examines the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, as well as the
                behavior of markets and the factors influencing economic outcomes.</p>
            <p>Economics is divided into two main branches: microeconomics, which focuses on individual agents and
                markets, and macroeconomics, which deals with the economy as a whole, including topics such as
                inflation, unemployment, and economic growth.</p>
            <p>Understanding economics is essential for making informed decisions in various areas, including
                business, public policy, finance, and international trade.</p>

        <!-- Slide 2: Key Concepts in Economics -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Key Concepts in Economics</h2>
            <p>Economics involves several key concepts and principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scarcity:</strong> The fundamental economic problem of limited resources and unlimited
                    wants, which requires individuals and societies to make choices about how to allocate resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Supply and Demand:</strong> The relationship between the quantity of a good or service
                    supplied by producers and the quantity demanded by consumers, which determines prices and market
                    equilibrium.</li>
                <li><strong>Opportunity Cost:</strong> The value of the next best alternative forgone when a decision
                    is made, representing the cost of choosing one option over another.</li>
                <li><strong>Production Possibility Frontier (PPF):</strong> A graphical representation of the maximum
                    combinations of goods and services that can be produced with limited resources, illustrating
                    trade-offs between different choices.</li>
                <li><strong>Elasticity:</strong> The responsiveness of quantity demanded or supplied to changes in
                    price or other factors, which influences the sensitivity of markets to changes in conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Structures:</strong> The different types of market organization, including
                    perfect competition, monopoly, monopolistic competition, and oligopoly, which affect pricing,
                    competition, and efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Macroeconomic Indicators:</strong> Measures such as gross domestic product (GDP),
                    inflation rate, unemployment rate, and interest rates, which provide insights into the overall
                    health and performance of an economy.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 3: Economic Systems -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Economic Systems</h2>
            <p>Economic systems determine how societies organize production, distribution, and consumption. The main
                types of economic systems are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Capitalism:</strong> An economic system based on private ownership of the means of
                    production and the pursuit of profit through market competition, with limited government
                    intervention.</li>
                <li><strong>Socialism:</strong> An economic system in which the means of production are owned or
                    controlled by the state or the community, with the goal of achieving social equality and
                    collective welfare.</li>
                <li><strong>Mixed Economy:</strong> A combination of capitalist and socialist elements, with both
                    private and public ownership of resources and varying degrees of government regulation and
                    intervention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each economic system has its advantages and drawbacks, and debates continue about the optimal
                organization of economic activity to promote efficiency, equity, and sustainability.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 4: Economic Policies -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Economic Policies</h2>
            <p>Governments use various economic policies to manage and stabilize economies, address market failures,
                and promote economic growth and development. Some common economic policies include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monetary Policy:</strong> Control of the money supply and interest rates by central banks
                    to influence borrowing, spending, and inflation.</li>
                <li><strong>Fiscal Policy:</strong> Use of government spending and taxation to regulate aggregate
                    demand, stabilize the economy, and achieve macroeconomic objectives.</li>
                <li><strong>Trade Policy:</strong> Regulation of international trade through tariffs, quotas,
                    subsidies, and trade agreements to protect domestic industries, promote exports, and regulate
                    imports.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial Policy:</strong> Government support for specific industries or sectors through
                    subsidies, tax incentives, and investment to stimulate growth, innovation, and competitiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Policy:</strong> Establishment and enforcement of rules and regulations to
                    ensure fair competition, consumer protection, environmental sustainability, and financial
                    stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Development Policy:</strong> Strategies to reduce poverty, inequality, and
                    underdevelopment through targeted investments in education, healthcare, infrastructure, and social
                    welfare.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Effective economic policies require careful analysis, coordination, and implementation to achieve
                desired outcomes while minimizing unintended consequences.</p>
