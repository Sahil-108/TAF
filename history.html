            <h2>Introduction to History</h2>
            <p>History is the study of past events, particularly human affairs. It encompasses a wide range of topics,
                including political, social, economic, cultural, and military events and developments.</p>
            <p>Studying history helps us understand how societies have evolved over time, the causes and consequences
                of historical events, and their impact on the present.</p>
            <p>It provides insights into human behavior, patterns of change, continuity, and the complexities of
                historical narratives.</p>
            <p>History is not just about memorizing dates and facts but interpreting evidence, analyzing perspectives,
                and constructing narratives based on critical thinking and research.</p>

        <!-- Slide 4: Historiographical Debates -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Historiographical Debates</h2>
            <p>Historical scholarship often involves debates and interpretations of evidence:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interpretations:</strong> Historians may offer different interpretations of the same
                    events or periods based on their perspectives, biases, and methodologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Controversies:</strong> Some historical topics and narratives are controversial, sparking
                    debates and disagreements among scholars and the public.</li>
                <li><strong>Revisions:</strong> Historical interpretations evolve over time as new evidence emerges
                    and perspectives change, leading to revisions of previous understandings.</li>
                <li><strong>Diversity of Voices:</strong> Historiography seeks to include diverse voices and
                    perspectives, including those marginalized or previously overlooked by traditional historical
                    narratives.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> Historians grapple with ethical questions regarding the
                    representation, interpretation, and presentation of historical events, particularly those involving
                    sensitive or traumatic subjects.</li>
