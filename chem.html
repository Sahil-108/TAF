            <h2>Introduction to Chemistry</h2>
            <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the composition, structure, properties, and reactions
                of matter, especially at the atomic and molecular levels.</p>
            <p>It is often called the central science because it connects and overlaps with other scientific disciplines
                such as physics, biology, environmental science, and materials science.</p>
            <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us, from the food we eat to the
                medications we take, from the materials we use to the environment we live in.</p>

        <!-- Slide 4: Basic Knowledge Required for Choosing Chemistry in 11th Class -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Basic Knowledge Required for Choosing Chemistry in 11th Class</h2>
            <p>Before deciding to study chemistry in the 11th class, it's important for students to have a solid
                foundation in scientific concepts and problem-solving skills acquired during their Class 10 studies.
                Here are some key points to consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understanding of Scientific Concepts:</strong> Students should have a good grasp of basic
                    scientific principles such as matter, energy, atoms, molecules, and chemical reactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Mathematical Skills:</strong> Chemistry involves mathematical calculations and equations.
                    Students should be comfortable with basic mathematical operations, algebra, and unit conversions.</li>
                <li><strong>Critical Thinking:</strong> Chemistry requires analytical thinking and problem-solving
                    skills. Students should be able to analyze data, draw conclusions, and evaluate the validity of
                    scientific claims.</li>
                <li><strong>Interest in Experimental Work:</strong> Chemistry involves laboratory experiments and
                    hands-on activities. Students should enjoy conducting experiments and observing chemical
                    phenomena.</li>
                <li><strong>Preparation for Higher Education:</strong> Studying chemistry in the 11th class lays the
                    foundation for further education in chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, pharmacy, and
                    other related fields.</li>
                <li><strong>Future Career Prospects:</strong> Chemistry offers diverse career opportunities in
                    research, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, environmental science, agriculture, and industry. Students
                    should consider their interests and career goals when choosing to study chemistry.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By possessing a strong understanding of these concepts and skills acquired during Class 10, students can
                make an informed decision about whether to pursue chemistry in the 11th class.</p>
